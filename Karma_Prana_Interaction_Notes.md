# Karma & Prana — Interaction Notes

## Prana (soft, real-time session signals) — Read-only 💡
- **Role:** Session pacing, ephemeral metrics, and soft signals about the live session.
- **Allowed use:** AI Being may read Prana for pacing or context-awareness only (e.g., to avoid long monologues). Use is read-only and non-binding.
- **Prohibition:** Prana must **not** be used to influence enforcement or to alter decision logic.

## Karma (post-decision evaluation) — Write-only ⚠️
- **Role:** Post-decision evaluation, auditing, and offline learning signals.
- **Allowed use:** Systems may write Karma events after a decision has been finalized for auditing and analysis.
- **Prohibition:** Karma is write-only and must not be used in real-time to influence current decisions.

## Confirmations
- Both Prana and Karma are explicitly scoped to avoid live decision influence:
  - Prana = read-only, ephemeral session context only.
  - Karma = write-only, post-decision analytics only.

*If any live system behaves differently, add a TODO here and stop integration until clarified.*
